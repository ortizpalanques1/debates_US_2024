# 2024 Presidential Debates. Text Analysis

## Goals
### General Goal
Establish and compare the main trends in the candidates' arguments.

### Specific Goals
1. Quantitative: Number of words used by each candidate.
2. Most used words.
3. Negative and positive associations of the most used words.
4. Within debate comparison: Which words were used the most by each candidate? Comparison in the use of similar words, if any.
5. Between debate comparison: Differences by party. For Trump, differences in time.

## Scope
